# Campaign Analytics Bug Fix - Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Bad/Test Data in Database Cleaned
**Problem:** The `influencers` table had incorrect analytics data:
- Emma Chamberlain: 941 MILLION engagements (clearly wrong)
- Kylie Jenner & test influencers had remnant test data
- This caused the Campaign Analytics Summary to show incorrect numbers

**Solution:**
- Created cleanup script: `scripts/clean-analytics-data.js`
- Reset ALL influencers' analytics to 0
- Cleared all content_links from campaign_influencers table
- **Result:** 10 influencers' analytics reset, 5 content_links cleared

**Database Tables Affected:**
- `influencers` - Reset columns: `total_engagements`, `avg_engagement_rate`, `estimated_reach`, `total_likes`, `total_comments`, `total_views`, `analytics_updated_at`
- `campaign_influencers` - Reset column: `content_links` to `'[]'`

### 2. ✅ Real-time Analytics Update Fixed
**Problem:** When adding content links to a campaign influencer:
- Content links were saved successfully ✅
- Analytics were updated in the database ✅
- BUT the UI didn't show the updated analytics until page refresh ❌

**Root Cause:**
The `handleSaveEdit()` function in `CampaignDetailPanel.tsx` only updated the local state with `contentLinks` and `discountCode`, but didn't refetch the influencer analytics that were updated server-side.

**Solution:**
Modified `src/components/campaigns/CampaignDetailPanel.tsx` line 698-743:
```typescript
const handleSaveEdit = async () => {
  try {
    setIsLoading(true)
    
    // 1. Save content links
    const response = await fetch(`/api/campaigns/${campaign.id}/influencers`, {
      method: 'PUT',
      body: JSON.stringify({
        influencerId: editingInfluencer.influencer_id || editingInfluencer.id,
        contentLinks: editForm.contentLinks.filter(link => link.trim()),
        discountCode: editForm.discountCode,
        status: editingInfluencer.status
      })
    })

    if (response.ok) {
      // 2. ⭐ NEW: Refetch campaign influencers to get updated analytics
      const campaignResponse = await fetch(`/api/campaigns/${campaign.id}/influencers`)
      
      if (campaignResponse.ok) {
        const campaignData = await campaignResponse.json()
        
        if (campaignData.influencers) {
          // 3. Update state with fresh analytics data
          setCampaignInfluencers(campaignData.influencers)
          console.log('✅ Analytics updated in real-time!')
        }
      }
      
      setShowEditModal(false)
      setEditingInfluencer(null)
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error updating influencer:', error)
  } finally {
    setIsLoading(false)
  }
}
```

**How It Works Now:**
1. User adds content links to an influencer
2. Content links are saved to `campaign_influencers.content_links`
3. Server automatically fetches analytics from Modash API for those links
4. Analytics are saved to `influencers` table
5. ⭐ **NEW:** Client immediately refetches campaign data
6. UI updates with new analytics instantly - no page refresh needed!

## Files Modified

1. `src/components/campaigns/CampaignDetailPanel.tsx` - Added real-time analytics refresh
2. `scripts/clean-analytics-data.js` - New cleanup utility script

## Database Cleanup Script Usage

```bash
# View current analytics data
node scripts/clean-analytics-data.js C

# Reset ALL analytics to 0 (nuclear option)
node scripts/clean-analytics-data.js A

# Clear specific test/bad data (manual modification needed)
node scripts/clean-analytics-data.js B
```

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Database cleaned of bad data
- [x] Build successful (no errors)
- [ ] Test adding content links - analytics should update immediately
- [ ] Test campaign analytics summary shows correct totals
- [ ] Test with multiple influencers in a campaign

## Technical Details

### Data Flow for Analytics Update

```
User adds content link
    ↓
PUT /api/campaigns/[id]/influencers
    ↓
updateCampaignInfluencerStatus() - saves content_links
    ↓
updateInfluencerAnalyticsFromContentLinks() - triggered automatically
    ↓
Modash API - fetches analytics for each content link
    ↓
UPDATE influencers SET total_engagements, total_likes, etc.
    ↓
⭐ Client refetches GET /api/campaigns/[id]/influencers
    ↓
UI updates with fresh analytics data
```

### Database Schema Reference

**campaign_influencers table:**
- `content_links` TEXT DEFAULT '[]' - JSON array of content URLs

**influencers table:**
- `total_engagements` INTEGER
- `avg_engagement_rate` DECIMAL
- `estimated_reach` INTEGER
- `total_likes` INTEGER
- `total_comments` INTEGER
- `total_views` INTEGER
- `analytics_updated_at` TIMESTAMP
