# Roles & Permissions: Stride Social Dashboard

## Overview

This document defines the five user roles within the Stride Social Dashboard and outlines the precise permissions assigned to each. Permissions are enforced via Clerk authentication, session validation, and server-side role-based access control.

Each role has a distinct scope of access designed to protect data integrity, streamline workflows, and support operational clarity.
