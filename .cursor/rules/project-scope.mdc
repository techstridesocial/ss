# Project Scope

## Overview

This project involves designing and developing a custom influencer dashboard platform for **Stride Social**, a UK-based influencer marketing and talent management agency. The dashboard will enable seamless management of influencer data, campaign execution, and brand collaboration. It integrates the **Modash Discovery API** for influencer analytics and uses a **custom OAuth-based system** to access real-time social media data from influencers ‚Äî separate from the platform's login authentication.

## üßæ Data Access & Modash Integration

The dashboard integrates with the **Modash Discovery API** to:

- Discover and search public influencer profiles
- Generate audience and engagement reports using Modash report credits
- Enrich the internal influencer database with verified metrics and demographics

> All real-time performance data shown to clients is sourced from **connected influencer accounts**, not direct raw API outputs.

- Track OAuth connection status and readiness for activation
