# Analytics Debug Guide - Content Links Not Updating

## 🔍 **Comprehensive Debugging Added**

I've added extensive debugging throughout the entire analytics flow to help identify why content links aren't updating analytics. Here's what to look for:

---

## **1. Frontend Debugging** 

### **When you add content links and click "Save Changes", look for:**

```
💾 [FRONTEND DEBUG] Starting content links save...
💾 [FRONTEND DEBUG] Campaign ID: [campaign-id]
💾 [FRONTEND DEBUG] Influencer ID: [influencer-id]
💾 [FRONTEND DEBUG] Original content links: [array]
💾 [FRONTEND DEBUG] Filtered content links: [array]
💾 [FRONTEND DEBUG] Filtered links count: [number]
💾 [FRONTEND DEBUG] Auth token obtained: Yes/No
💾 [FRONTEND DEBUG] Request body: [JSON object]
💾 [FRONTEND DEBUG] Response status: [200/400/500]
💾 [FRONTEND DEBUG] Response ok: true/false
```

### **If successful, you should see:**
```
✅ [FRONTEND DEBUG] Content links saved successfully!
✅ [FRONTEND DEBUG] Backend response: [JSON]
🔄 [FRONTEND DEBUG] Now fetching updated analytics...
🔄 [FRONTEND DEBUG] Refresh response status: 200
🔄 [FRONTEND DEBUG] Refresh response ok: true
📊 [FRONTEND DEBUG] Fresh analytics data received: [JSON]
📊 [FRONTEND DEBUG] Found influencers in data.influencers: [number]
⚡ [FRONTEND DEBUG] ANALYTICS UPDATED INSTANTLY! Updated influencers: [number]
📊 [FRONTEND DEBUG] Updated influencer analytics: [object with analytics]
```

## **2. Backend API Debugging**

### **In the API endpoint, look for:**
```
📋 Updating campaign influencer using database: [object with campaignId, influencerId, contentLinks, discountCode]
🔍 Checking for content links: [object with contentLinks, hasContentLinks]
🔄 Content links detected - triggering automatic analytics update...
📋 Content links to process: [array]
👤 Influencer ID: [id]
🚀 Calling updateInfluencerAnalyticsFromContentLinks...
```

### **If analytics update succeeds:**
```
✅ Analytics automatically updated from content links for influencer: [id]
```

### **If analytics update fails:**
```
⚠️ Analytics update failed for influencer: [id]
❌ Error updating analytics automatically: [error details]
```

---

## **3. Analytics Updater Debugging**

### **When analytics updater runs, look for:**
```
🔄 [ANALYTICS DEBUG] Starting analytics update for influencer [id]
🔄 [ANALYTICS DEBUG] Content links provided: [array]
🔄 [ANALYTICS DEBUG] Content links length: [number]
🔄 [ANALYTICS DEBUG] Processing [number] content links...
🔄 [ANALYTICS DEBUG] Modash service imported successfully
```

### **For each content link:**
```
🔍 [ANALYTICS DEBUG] Processing content link: [URL]
🔍 [MODASH DEBUG] Getting media info for URL: [URL]
🔍 [MODASH DEBUG] Detected platform: [instagram/tiktok/youtube]
🔍 [MODASH DEBUG] Calling get[Platform]MediaInfo for: [URL]
📊 [MODASH DEBUG] Media info result for [URL]: [JSON object]
📊 [ANALYTICS DEBUG] Raw Modash response for [URL]: [JSON]
📈 [ANALYTICS DEBUG] Extracted analytics for [URL]: [object]
✅ [ANALYTICS DEBUG] Successfully extracted analytics from [URL]: [object]
```

### **Final analytics calculation:**
```
📊 [ANALYTICS DEBUG] Final analytics totals: [object with totals]
📈 [ANALYTICS DEBUG] Calculated metrics: [object with engagementRate, estimatedReach]
✅ [ANALYTICS DEBUG] Database update completed for influencer [id]
✅ [ANALYTICS DEBUG] Update query affected [number] rows
✅ [ANALYTICS DEBUG] Final analytics saved: [object with all analytics]
```

---

## **4. Modash API Debugging**

### **When Modash API is called, look for:**
```
🔍 [MODASH DEBUG] Getting media info for URL: [URL]
🔍 [MODASH DEBUG] Detected platform: [platform]
🔍 [MODASH DEBUG] Calling get[Platform]MediaInfo for: [URL]
✅ [MODASH DEBUG] Media info result for [URL]: [JSON response]
```

### **If Modash API fails:**
```
❌ [MODASH DEBUG] Error getting media info for [URL]: [error]
❌ Modash API Request Failed: [error details]
```

## **5. Common Issues to Check**

### **Issue 1: Content Links Not Being Sent**
**Look for:** `Filtered links count: 0`
**Solution:** Make sure you're entering valid URLs and they're not empty

### **Issue 2: Authentication Problems**
**Look for:** `Auth token obtained: No`
**Solution:** Check if you're logged in properly

### **Issue 3: Backend Not Receiving Links**
**Look for:** `No content links provided - analytics will remain at 0`
**Solution:** Check if the API is receiving the content links array

### **Issue 4: Modash API Not Working**
**Look for:** `❌ [MODASH DEBUG] Error getting media info`
**Solution:** Check if MODASH_API_KEY is set correctly

### **Issue 5: Database Not Updating**
**Look for:** `Update query affected 0 rows`
**Solution:** Check if the influencer ID exists in the database

### **Issue 6: Frontend Not Refreshing**
**Look for:** `❌ [FRONTEND DEBUG] Failed to refresh campaign data`
**Solution:** Check if the refresh API call is working

## **8. What to Report**

When you test this, please share:

1. **All console messages** from the frontend debug
2. **Any error messages** you see
3. **The exact URL** you're trying to add
4. **Whether the analytics columns update** or stay at 0
5. **Any backend error messages** in the console

This will help us identify exactly where the issue is occurring!
