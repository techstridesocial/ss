# Modash API Cleanup Summary

## ✅ What We've Done

### 1. Removed Test Routes
- ✅ Deleted `/api/discovery/test/`
- ✅ Deleted `/api/discovery/test-search/`
- ✅ Deleted `/api/discovery/test-search-v2/`
- ✅ Deleted `/api/discovery/test-cristiano-search/`
- ✅ Deleted `/api/discovery/test-profile/`
- ✅ Deleted `search/route.ts.backup`

### 2. Analyzed API Usage
- ✅ Identified 5 actively used endpoints
- ✅ Found 10 unused filter/analytics endpoints
- ✅ Created comprehensive API documentation

### 3. Fixed the Credits Bug
- ✅ Corrected endpoint from `/user/info` to `/v1/user/info`
- ✅ Fixed response parsing to match actual API structure
- ✅ Credits now display correctly: 200 used / 6010.24 available

## 📋 Current API Structure

### Active Endpoints (Used by Frontend)
1. **Credits**: `GET /api/discovery/credits`
2. **Search**: `POST /api/discovery/search` (simple search)
3. **Search V2**: `POST /api/discovery/search-v2` (advanced filters)
4. **Profile**: `POST /api/discovery/profile` (detailed data)
5. **Add to Roster**: `POST /api/discovery/add-to-roster`

### Unused Endpoints (Future Features?)
- Filter endpoints: hashtags, interests, languages, locations, topics, partnerships
- Analytics: performance-data, audience-overlap, list-users
- Duplicate: profile-report (redundant with profile)

## 🔄 Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Remove `profile-report`** - It's redundant with the main profile endpoint
2. **Document unused endpoints** - Add comments explaining they're for future use
3. **Add deprecation warnings** - If any endpoints will be removed

### Future Improvements
1. **Implement filter autocomplete** - Use the existing filter endpoints
2. **Add API versioning** - Prepare for future changes
3. **Create integration tests** - Ensure endpoints work correctly
4. **Monitor usage** - Track which endpoints are actually being called

## 📊 Impact

- **Before**: 21 discovery endpoints (messy, with test routes)
- **After**: 16 endpoints (organized, documented)
- **Removed**: 5 test endpoints + 1 backup file
- **Code Quality**: Much cleaner and easier to understand

## 🏗️ Architecture

The clean architecture now follows:
```
Frontend → API Routes (thin wrappers) → modashService → Modash API
```

All business logic is centralized in `/lib/services/modash.ts`, making it easier to maintain and test.
