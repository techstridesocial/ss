# Team Invitation Feature Test Plan

## âœ… Implementation Complete

### **New Features Added:**

1. **Step 15: "Would you like to invite team members to collaborate?"**
   - Radio options: "Yes, I'd like to invite team members" / "No, just me for now"
   - Optional step

2. **Step 16: "Invite your team members"** (Conditional)
   - Only shows if user selected "Yes" in Step 15
   - Two email input fields for team members
   - Visual feedback for "Ready to invite" status
   - Optional step - can be left blank

### **Updated Flow:**
- **Total Steps:** 24 (was 22)
- **Step Navigation:** Automatically skips Step 16 if user selected "No" in Step 15
- **Review Section:** Shows team member emails if provided
- **Database Storage:** Team members stored in `brand_contacts` table with `is_primary = false`

### **Test Scenarios:**

#### **Scenario 1: User Invites Team Members**
1. Complete onboarding to Step 15
2. Select "Yes, I'd like to invite team members"
3. Continue to Step 16
4. Enter email addresses for team members
5. Complete remaining steps
6. Verify team members appear in review section
7. Submit and verify database storage

#### **Scenario 2: User Skips Team Invitations**
1. Complete onboarding to Step 15
2. Select "No, just me for now"
3. Verify Step 16 is automatically skipped
4. Continue with remaining steps
5. Verify no team member section in review
6. Submit and verify only primary contact is stored

#### **Scenario 3: Partial Team Invitation**
1. Complete onboarding to Step 15
2. Select "Yes, I'd like to invite team members"

### **Database Verification:**

After successful onboarding, check `brand_contacts` table:

```sql
SELECT * FROM brand_contacts WHERE brand_id = [NEW_BRAND_ID] ORDER BY is_primary DESC;
```

Expected results:
- 1 primary contact (`is_primary = true`)
- 0-2 team member contacts (`is_primary = false`, `role = 'Team Member'`)
- Optional Stride contact if provided

- âœ… Smooth step transitions with conditional navigation
- âœ… Visual feedback for filled email fields
