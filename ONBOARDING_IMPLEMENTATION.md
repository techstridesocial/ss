## 🚀 **How It Works**

### **New Brand User Flow**:
1. Brand user signs up/logs in via Clerk
2. Client-side check queries `/api/brand/onboarding-status`
3. If `is_onboarded = false`, automatically redirected to `/brand/onboarding`
4. User completes 14-step onboarding process
5. Data saved to `brands` and `brand_contacts` tables
6. `user_profiles.is_onboarded` set to `true`
7. User redirected to brand dashboard with full access

### **Returning User Flow**:
1. Brand user logs in
2. Client-side check finds `is_onboarded = true`
3. Direct access to brand dashboard - no redirect
