   - Labels (add/remove)
   - Notes (text field)
5. Save and verify changes persist

### 2. Test Brand Assignment System
1. Go to `/staff/brands`
2. Find a brand in the table

4. Verify assignment is saved
5. Test filter by assignment
6. Check if notification was created

### 4. Test Notifications System
1. Make some assignments (brands, campaigns, creators)
2. Check notification bell icon
3. Open notifications dropdown
4. Verify notifications appear
5. Mark notifications as read
6. Verify read status persists

### 5. Test Staff Dashboard Filters
1. Go to each staff page (`/staff/brands`, `/staff/campaigns`, `/staff/roster`)
2. Test "My X" filters
3. Verify only assigned items show up
4. Test assignment filters in filter panels

## üîç Key Files to Verify

### Database Migrations Applied
- `brands.assigned_staff_id` column exists
- `campaigns.assigned_staff_id` column exists  
- `quotations.assigned_staff_id` column exists
- `influencers.assigned_to` is UUID type
- `notifications` table exists

### API Endpoints Working
- All endpoints return proper HTTP status codes
- Authentication is enforced (401 for unauthenticated)
- Validation works (400 for invalid data)
- Success responses include proper data

### Frontend Components Render
- No console errors in browser
- Dropdowns populate with staff members
- Filters work correctly
- State updates properly after API calls

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria

- [ ] All database schema changes are applied
- [ ] All API endpoints respond correctly
- [ ] Frontend components render without errors
- [ ] Assignment functionality works end-to-end
- [ ] Notifications system is functional
- [ ] Filter functionality works as expected
- [ ] No breaking changes to existing functionality

## üöÄ Quick Verification Commands

```bash
# Check if server is running
curl http://localhost:3000/api/health

# Test staff members endpoint
curl http://localhost:3000/api/staff/members

# Test authentication (should return 401)
curl http://localhost:3000/api/auth/current-user
```

## üìù Notes

- All endpoints require proper authentication (Clerk JWT)
- Database changes are permanent and cannot be easily rolled back
- Frontend state management uses React hooks and context
- Notifications use real-time updates where possible
